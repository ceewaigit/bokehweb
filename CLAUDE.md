# Screen Studio Clone - Full Feature Implementation

Build a complete 1:1 Screen Studio clone with all professional features.
IMPORTANT: YOUR CODE SHOULD BE STREAMLINED BUT NOT OVERLY COMPLEX. AIM FOR A BALANCED APPROACH THAT PRIORITIZES FUNCTIONALITY AND USER EXPERIENCE. REMEMBER, THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL TOOL, SO IT SHOULD BE POLISHED AND EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTION READY. HOWEVER, DO NOT OVER-ENGINEER; KEEP IT SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE.

## 🚨 PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS
**ALL code must work in PRODUCTION (packaged .dmg/.exe):**
- NO external servers or localhost dependencies
- Electron must serve the Next.js app internally via webpack
- All assets must be bundled with the app
- Test with `npm run make` to create distributable
- NEVER assume dev server is running
- NO FALLBACKS that hide real issues - fix root causes

## ⚡ CRITICAL WEBPACK CONFIG
- renderer.tsx routes components via URL hash (#/record-button)
- Preload uses MAIN_WINDOW_PRELOAD_WEBPACK_ENTRY variable
- Record button component lives in src/app/record-button/page.tsx
- Dev: DEV_SERVER_URL env var overrides localhost:3000
- Prod: webpack bundles everything, no Next.js server needed

### 4. Background & Framing

## Implementation Priority

1. **Fix video playback** - Timeline must show actual video preview
2. **Implement zoom effects** - Core Screen Studio feature
3. **Add cursor rendering** - Smooth, professional cursor overlay
4. **Background system** - Gradient/image backgrounds
5. **Timeline editing** - Cut, trim, split functionality
6. **Export with effects** - Apply all effects during export
7. **Polish animations** - Smooth 60fps throughout

## Commands
```bash
npm run electron-dev     # Development
npm run build-electron   # Production build
npm test                 # Run all tests automatically
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests only
npm run test:e2e        # Run end-to-end tests only
npm run test:autoclick   # Quick test for auto-click feature
```

## Test Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/               # Fast isolated tests (constraints, effects, export)
├── integration/        # Component integration tests
├── e2e/               # Full app end-to-end tests
└── run-all.js         # Master test runner
```

## 🎯 QUICK REMINDERS
- Zoom: smoothStep/easeOutExpo for native feel
- Cursor: macOS style with motion blur implemented
- Export: frame caching = 30-50% faster
- Background: renderer ready, needs UI controls
- Audio: works, needs system capture permissions
- Timeline: basic only, NO editing yet
- Webcam: NOT implemented
- Export: WebM only, needs FFmpeg for MP4
